## Description

The iPump Indicator for MT4 is designed to assist traders in identifying trends, support and resistance levels, and overbought/oversold zones in the forex market. It provides the necessary functions to detect trends, assess support and resistance levels, and determine overbought/oversold zones.

### Trend Detection Function

The `detectTrend` function is responsible for detecting the current trend based on the specified timeframe. Traders can customize the trend detection logic within this function.

### Support and Resistance Levels Function

The `assessLevels` function determines the type of support and resistance levels based on the given price. Traders can modify the support and resistance level assessment logic within this function.

### Overbought and Oversold Zones Function

The `determineOverboughtOversold` function determines whether the given price is in an overbought or oversold zone. Traders can customize the overbought and oversold zone determination logic within this function.

### Initialization, Deinitialization, and Start Functions

The `OnInit` function is called during the indicator's initialization. Traders can initialize necessary variables and indicators within this function.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the indicator is being deinitialized. Traders can perform necessary cleanup tasks within this function.

The `OnStart` function is the main entry point for the indicator's logic. It calls the `detectTrend`, `assessLevels`, and `determineOverboughtOversold` functions to determine the current trend, support/resistance level, and overbought/oversold zone. Traders can implement their trading logic based on these factors and manage trades accordingly. The function also calculates a conclusion based on the current trend, support/resistance level, and overbought/oversold zone, and outputs the conclusion using the `Alert` function.
